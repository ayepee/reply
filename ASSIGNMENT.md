# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned the library by looking through the API documentation which included code examples that helped me create examples. The module code's varable names and function names made understanding the API code much easier. In a minor scale, one change that would make it easier is to include the way the password functionality works from Commander Lib.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Rasing the level of abstractions in comments means to generalize what something does in the most simplest form of understanding without including any implementation details about what the code does/takes in as parameters/return values/etc. I would explain to new CSE142 students that writing an effective comment should be a summary of what something does(ex: functions, loops, returns) written in a way that is easily read by someone with no programming experience. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 10


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IS2St0nf1k and Slack responses from Joel.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> The only probally that I encountered was being unable to parse path/to/index.js because of Octal literals, since they are not allowed in strict mode. Much of this problem occured because of my choice of module that I decided to work with for this assignment. Nothing the Prof. could have done to make this assignment better regarding this. However, providing an idea of valid jsdoc comments are writtin would have prevented a lot of doubts during the entire assignment.
